    <p>I am a software engineer with an undergraduate degree in Computer Science from Bryn Mawr College. I have experience that covers all areas of development cycle, from mockup to deployment. I currently work at CardConnect on their web applications in an agile Kanban development environment with Scrum. My work includes front-end and back-end bug fixes and new features using Javascript, AngularJS, HTML, CSS, Spring Framework, Java and SQL. Additionally, I regularly analyze our existing code for scalability and UX experience and work on terminal integrations and merchant PCI compliance for our internal and client facing applications.</p>
